    I'd like very much to have a function to format a
    number eventually inserting leading zeroes in front of it. For istance:
    format_picture(100.023, '##,###.##')     yields   '000100.02'
    format_picture(1000.023, '##,###.##')   yields   '01,000.02'
    [wrw] How about: '0#,###.##' yields '01,000.02' but '##,###.##'
	  yields ' 1,000.02'?
